# Sample templates for go-server

This repository is sample code explained in detail in
[this blog post on noobs.quest](https://www.noobs.quest/go/go-openapi-server-generation-with-jwt/).
It modifies the templates provided by the `go-server` generator in
[OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) such that
they can add JWT authentication/authorization to endpoints.
